# GPU_implemetation_of_Tanner_lower_bound
Matlab GPU/CPU implementation for Fundamental Tanner lower bound estimation on code distance (both codewords and TS pseudocodewords). 
Estimate lower bound of code distance and heuristics optimization second_eigen/first_eigen  to choice best code in ensemble, very fast sieving from code distance, especialy important for low rate codes as Vontobel proof it tight bound to Trapping Sets pseudocodewords weight too.

This  works answear on  question "Why Loopy BP wook?" from graph probabalistical model under example of LDPC codes. Give good heuristics on sieving of code in one ensemble (family) using spectral theory (Expanders)
