# GPU_implemetation_of_Tanner_lower_bound
Matlab GPU/CPU implementation for Tanner lower bound estimation on code distance
Estimate lower bound of code distance and heuristics optimization second_eigen/first_eigen  to choice best code in ensemble, very fast sieving from code distance, especialy important for low rate codes as Vontobel proof it tight bound to Trapping Sets pseudocodewords weight too.
